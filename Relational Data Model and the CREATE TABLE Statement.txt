    1. Write a CREATE TABLE statement for the Customer table. Choose data types appropriate for the DBMS used in your course. All columns are required (not null).

    Query:

    create  table Customer(custno int Primary key, 
    					   custname varchar(15) not null,
    					   address varchar(15) not null,
    					   Internal char(1) not null,
    					   contact varchar(15) not null, 
    					   phone bigint not null,
    					   city varchar(15) not null,
    					   state char(2) not null,
    					   zip int not null);

2.Write a CREATE TABLE statement for the Facility table. Choose data types appropriate for the DBMS used in your course. All columns are required (not null).

Query:

create table Facility(facno int Primary key,
     					facname varchar(15) not null);


3.Write a CREATE TABLE statement for the Location table. Choose data types appropriate for the DBMS used in your course. LocName column is required (not null).

Query:

 create table Location(locno int Primary key, 
 					   facno int, locname varchar(15) not null , 
 					   Constraint fk Foreign key (facno) references Facility(facno));

 4. Identify the foreign key(s) and 1-M relationship(s) among the Customer, Facility, and Location tables. For each relationship, identify the parent table and the child table.

 	==>There is one foreign key in Location table (facno) that references primary key of Facility;
 	==>Also one 1-many relationship i.e one facility can book multiple locations.
